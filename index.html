<h1 class="top">Hi, I'm Sergei</h1>

<p>Hello! I'm Sergei Novozhilov. I am a final-year PhD candidate at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), where I am a member of the <a href="https://amir.goharshady.com/group">ALPACAS (Algorithms, Logic, Program Analysis, Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts)</a> research group, led by <a href="https://amir.goharshady.com/home">Prof. Amir Goharshady</a>. I am fortunate to be co-supervised by <a href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/~dipapado/">Prof. Dimitris Papadopoulos</a>, from whom I have received constant support, both academically and personally. I have also received significant advice and guidance from <a href="https://fiction-zju.github.io/author/mingshuai-chen/">Dr. Mingshuai Chen</a>. My research journey has been greatly enriched by my collaboration with the <a href="https://fiction-zju.github.io/">FICTION (Formal Verification)</a> group.</p>


<p>My research focuses on enhancing the security, efficiency, and reliability of complex software systems by bridging the gap between theoretical computer science and practical applications. I specialize in <strong>Formal Methods</strong> and <strong>Program Analysis</strong>, developing techniques to provide formal guarantees about software behavior. My work in this area includes analyzing the termination properties of <strong>Probabilistic Programs</strong> and automatically synthesizing tight resource bounds for recursive systems. A primary application domain for my research is <strong>Blockchain and Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</strong>, where I leverage my expertise in <strong>Algorithms and Optimization</strong> to address critical challenges in this space.</p>

<!-- <h2>Research Vision</h2>

<h2>Teaching Vision</h2> -->


<h2>Diversity, Equality & Inclusion</h2>
<p>I am deeply committed to fostering an environment of diversity, equity, and inclusion in all my professional activities. I believe that a rich variety of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences is fundamental to academic excellence, innovative research, and personal growth. A community where everyone feels respected and valued is a community where everyone can thrive.</p>

<p>In my teaching, I strive to create a respectful learning space where every student feels welcomed to participate. This means actively encouraging dialogue from all voices, incorporating diverse examples and materials into the curriculum, and being mindful of the different learning styles and needs of my students.</p>

<p>
        To translate these principles into practice, here are some of the concrete measures I am dedicated to implementing:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Broadening the Pipeline into STEM:</strong> I will actively support outreach initiatives, such as workshops and competitive Olympiads, for pre-university students, with a focus on engaging those from underrepresented communities. The goal is to spark early interest and demonstrate that a career in science and technology is an exciting and attainable path for everyone.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Dedicated and Anonymous Communication:</strong> To ensure all students can voice concerns freely, I will establish a <strong>distinct and anonymous feedback channel</strong> for my courses. This provides a safe avenue for students to address the course climate, content, or personal challenges without fear of judgment or academic penalty.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Accessible and Flexible Design:</strong> I will design course materials and assessments with <a href="https://udlguidelines.cast.org/">Universal Design principles</a> in mind to ensure they are accessible to all learners. I will also offer flexibility where possible, recognizing that students learn in different ways and may face unique personal circumstances.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>I recognize that building a truly inclusive community is an ongoing process. I am always learning and am open to feedback on how I can improve. If you have any concerns, suggestions, or require accommodations to fully participate in my courses or research, please do not hesitate to speak with me.</p>
